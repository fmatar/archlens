# Assistant Guidelines

## Archlens Clean Architecture Workbench Companion Protocol

This project is governed by the **Archlens Dynamic Clean Architecture Workbench**.
- **Workbench UI & API**: `http://localhost:8088`
- **Architectural Policy**: `.archlens/policy.json`
- **Mailbox IPC**:
  - Inbound queue: `.archlens/to-agent.json`
  - Outbound response: `.archlens/to-viewer.json`

### Handling Mailbox Commands:
1. **REGEN**: Re-index AST, evaluate package dependency rules, and acknowledge.
2. **APPLY_PROPOSAL**: Reorganize packages to conform to concentric rings (Adapters -> Application -> Domain Core). Where an inner layer relies on an outer layer, apply the **Dependency Inversion Principle** by creating an interface port in the inner layer and implementing it in the outer layer.
3. **REFRESH_CRAP**: Execute test suite and report code coverage metrics.
